# TicTacToe for my school project
#### This repository is all about this game. Soon there will be an advanced version with 4x4 and 5x5 filed!
#### U can also run my app on _repl.it_
#### All you need to do is just set this commands:
#### language = "java"
#### run = "javac -classpath .:/run_dir/junit-4.12.jar:target/dependency/* -d . src/com/company/Main.java src/com/company/GameProcess.java src/com/company/StartGame.java src/com/company/TicTacToe.java"
#### And then add "java com/company/Main" and that is it!!!  
#### Also note that there can be troubles _with case lines in TicTacToe class_. So then _(only if you have one)_ change case code to a standard one.
#### Hope you enjoy this one :)
